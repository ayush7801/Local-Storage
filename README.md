# Local-Storage
This repo demonstrates the  browser local storage and event delegation.

The Local Storage is an API. It allows developer to store data in browser according to perticular domain so that the data won't be lost even when the page is reloaded, That then could be used accordingly.

local storage is same as sessional storage except that while localStorage data has no expiration time, sessionStorage data gets cleared when the page session ends â€” that is, when the page is closed.
